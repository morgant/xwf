INSTALL
-------

Extract the source code archive in a directory where you want, e.g.
in your HOME directory with the following command:

    tar -xzvf xwf-<version>.tar.gz

This will create a subdirectory "xwf". Change into this directory.

	1. Run "make"
	3. Then run "make install"

If you have done these steps, try to start "xwf"

Don't forget to install the mini-icons of xwf if your window-manager
likes it...

NOTE: don't forget, you need glib/gtk+ 2.0 or newer!
